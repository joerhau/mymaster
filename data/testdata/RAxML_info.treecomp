RAxML computation of RF distances for all pairs of trees in a set of trees


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -T 4 -f r -z trees -m PROTGAMMAWAG -n treecomp 




Found 3 trees in File trees



Average relative RF in this set: 0.000000

File containing all 3 pair-wise RF distances written to file /home/joerhau/Dropbox/RAxML-Light/data/testdata/RAxML_RF-Distances.treecomp
