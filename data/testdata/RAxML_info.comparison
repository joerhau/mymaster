RAxML computation of RF distances for all pairs of trees in a set of trees


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -T 4 -f r -z tmp -m PROTGAMMAWAG -n comparison 




Found 2 trees in File tmp



Average relative RF in this set: 0.000000

File containing all 1 pair-wise RF distances written to file /home/joerhau/Dropbox/RAxML-Light/data/testdata/RAxML_RF-Distances.comparison
