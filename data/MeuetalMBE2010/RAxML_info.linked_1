IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 8 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.


Just in case you might need it, a mixed model file with 
model assignments for undetermined columns removed is printed to file linked_models_1.part.reduced
An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file 1.phy.reduced

Alignment has 302 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 50.29%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 2 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
