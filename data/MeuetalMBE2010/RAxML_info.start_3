IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 7 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file 3.phy.reduced

Alignment has 402 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 37.22%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees
